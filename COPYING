 The scripts/python/module/nut_telnetlib.py file is copied for fall-back
 purposes from Python 3.10, and released under its original license (the
 PSF License Version 2). It was only modified in the comment section to
 describe the copy, purpose and provenance per section 3 of the license.
 According to https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.10/LICENSE most of
 the licenses Python was provided under over the years are GPL-compatible.

 Other files in the scripts/python/ directory are released under GNU General
 Public License (GPL) version 3, or (at your option) any later version. See
 "LICENSE-GPL3" in the root of this distribution.

 The Perl client module (scripts/perl/Nut.pm) is released under the same
 license as Perl itself. That is to say either GPL version 1 or (at your option)
 any later version, or the "Artistic License".

 Several fallback implementations for methods absent from standard library of
 an end-user's current build platform are derived from source code available
 under the two-clause BSD license (common/strptime.c, common/strnlen.c)

 Various methods may be adapted from code or ideas posted on Stack Exchange
 sites (comments in NUT sources refer to original posts in this case), which
 according to https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing are made available under
 different Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (CC BY-SA) versions
 depending on contribution timestamp.

 Several autoconf methods under m4/ directory are derived from curl codebase
 and were originally available under curl license. Which is not unlike the MIT
 license, see https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/06/17/curl-is-reuse-compliant/

 To the best of our knowledge, conditions of the 2/3-clause BSD, MIT, curl and
 CC BY-SA licenses allow redistribution and reuse of the codebase in projects
 made available under GPL license terms, as long as attribution is provided.

 NUT contributors are encouraged to "sign off" their git commits as a conscious
 act done under Developer's Certificate of Origin. See the copy of "LICENSE-DCO"
 in the root of this distribution, but please note that it is not a "license" on
 its own - rather a proclamation that work was done and submitted according to
 applicable open-source licenses.
